A few months back, I was telling one of my mates about a fantastic little getaway that my wife and I had recently enjoyed. Superb accommodation, beautiful scenery, delicious food and a shiraz that you would sell your nan for (well maybe for a case of it). 

When he asked what the occasion was for us to celebrate in such a manner, I replied..."nothing really, just to getaway and enjoy being a couple again". The gob smacked look on his face both surprised and amused me. Here was a fella who's idea of a romantic night out with his lovely was a trip to Gold Class to see the latest blockbuster (that was most likely of his choosing, although I do suspect he enjoyed Magic Mike 2 more than he should have). "How do you come up with these ideas? You & Meags are always off somewhere and doing cool stuff... you're a bloody romantic aren't you!" The words came out of his mouth in an almost accusing manner; (you're one of those aren't you... one of those undesirable romantic types that makes us regular blokes look like miserable bastards in our wives/girlfriends/partner's eyes....you mongrel). 

So yeah, I'm happy to admit that I am a bit of a romantic. I love spending time with my wife, and enjoy spoiling her to show that I appreciate all the grief and challenges that the kids and I put her through. I also highly value the fact that while our family is now four members strong, it started out as two....and when life gets a bit out of whack with work commitments, kids' school commitments, kids' sport commitments, paying bills commitments, cleaning up the house commitments and all the other things that take time away from you as a couple.... well it's time to re-connect and celebrate your relationship. 

Let's face it, your relationships with loved ones is the most important thing in your life. Everything else is white noise. Look after things on the home front and everything else, even if it is causing you anxiety and sleepless nights, will eventually work out if you continue to be a united team (but that discussion is for another day). 

So it got me thinking, this conversation with my old buddy who fell out of the romantic tree and missed every branch on the way down, that maybe there's more blokes out there that struggle for inspiration and can do with a little help (or kick in the arse). The Romantic Bloke was born! 

Just to paint the picture for you, I'm not a suave and debonair inner city type who is going to give you tips and ideas on the single life (it didn't work that well when I was a bachelor and to me Tinder sounds like something you start a camp fire with). I'm a 42 year old, balding (well bald), big lump of a bloke who lives in suburbia and loves a beer, hangs for the annual red wine trip getaway with the boys and even gets out to play Vets cricket every fortnight. During winter I'll be found abusing AFL umpires, cheering on the Saints or devouring my favourite lamb shanks. A normal suburban bloke who adores his missus and kids. The Romantic Bloke is not me but all of you blokes out there that maybe have just forgotten the art of romancing the love of your life and could do with some inspiration. 

We'll help turn you into a man who will dazzle the old 'Cheese & Kisses' with a night out or a few days away where she will remember all those many reasons why she's still with you! So if you need some ideas for date nights, getaways, little gestures (the ones that really matter) theromanticbloke.com.au is your one stop shop.

So to get you started, my first review will be of the place that started this whole little venture... the site of our romantic getaway last October; 

Balgownie Estate Winery in the Yarra Valley. Enjoy!
