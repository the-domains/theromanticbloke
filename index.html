</picture><p>A few months back, I was telling one of my mates about a fantastic little getaway that my wife and I had recently enjoyed. Superb accommodation, beautiful scenery, delicious food and a shiraz that you would sell your nan for (well maybe for a case of
    it). When he asked what the occasion was for us to celebrate in such a manner, I replied..."nothing really, just to getaway and enjoy being a couple again". The gob smacked look on his face both surprised and amused me. Here was a fella who's idea
    of a romantic night out with his lovely was a trip to Gold Class to see the latest blockbuster (that was most likely of his choosing, although I do suspect he enjoyed Magic Mike 2 more than he should have). "How do you come up with these ideas? You
    & Meags are always off somewhere and doing cool stuff... you're a bloody romantic aren't you!" The words came out of his mouth in an almost accusing manner; (you're one of those aren't you... one of those undesirable romantic types that makes us regular
    blokes look like miserable bastards in our wives/girlfriends/partner's eyes....you mongrel). So yeah, I'm happy to admit that I am a bit of a romantic. I love spending time with my wife, and enjoy spoiling her to show that I appreciate all the grief
    and challenges that the kids and I put her through. I also highly value the fact that while our family is now four members strong, it started out as two....and when life gets a bit out of whack with work commitments, kids' school commitments, kids'
    sport commitments, paying bills commitments, cleaning up the house commitments and all the other things that take time away from you as a couple.... well it's time to re-connect and celebrate your relationship. Let's face it, your relationships with
    loved ones is the most important thing in your life. Everything else is white noise. Look after things on the home front and everything else, even if it is causing you anxiety and sleepless nights, will eventually work out if you continue to be a
    united team (but that discussion is for another day).So it got me thinking, this conversation with my old buddy who fell out of the romantic tree and missed every branch on the way down, that maybe there's more blokes out there that struggle for inspiration
    and can do with a little help (or kick in the arse). The Romantic Bloke was born! Just to paint the picture for you, I'm not a suave and debonair inner city type who is going to give you tips and ideas on the single life (it didn't work that well
    when I was a bachelor and to me Tinder sounds like something you start a camp fire with). I'm a 42 year old, balding (well bald), big lump of a bloke who lives in suburbia and loves a beer, hangs for the annual red wine trip getaway with the boys
    and even gets out to play Vets cricket every fortnight. During winter I'll be found abusing AFL umpires, cheering on the Saints or devouring my favourite lamb shanks. A normal suburban bloke who adores his missus and kids. The Romantic Bloke is not
    me but all of you blokes out there that maybe have just forgotten the art of romancing the love of your life and could do with some inspiration. We'll help turn you into a man who will dazzle the old 'Cheese & Kisses' with a night out or a few days
    away where she will remember all those many reasons why she's still with you! So if you need some ideas for date nights, getaways, little gestures (the ones that really matter) <a href="http://theromanticbloke.com.au" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">theromanticbloke.com.au</a>    is your one stop shop.

    our romantic getaway last October; Balgownie Estate Winery in the Yarra Valley.

The Yarra Valley is one of our favourite destinations, with it's beautiful scenery, brilliant wine and plethora of great places to stay (& it's also a cruise 45 minute drive from our home). For our little getaway last October, we chose Balgownie Estate due to the recommendation of a friend and we certainly weren't disappointed. We booked a one bedroom spa suite that was a perfect option for a romantic night away. The location of the spa allows you to gaze out over the rolling valleys beyond Yarra Glen (although our ground floor apartment meant that you needed to keep an eye out for other guests that were occasionally strolling by!) A very cosy and comfortable lounge area, roomy balcony and well sized kitchenette made the accommodation a superb spot to base yourself for some Yarra Valley touring. A few other highlights at Balgownie were the cellar door; fantastic wines, friendly and knowledgable service (the Maiden Gully Shiraz was one of the best reds I've ever had the pleasure of tasting). Dinner at Rae's Restaurant was delicious, both of us loved our meals (lamb shank and the fish) and once again, service was top notch. I really can't recommend Balgownie Estate highly enough... hopefully we'll return again soon. <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com.au/ShowUserReviews-g552277-d616758-r365513477-Balgownie_Estate_Vineyard_Resort_Spa-Yarra_Glen_Yarra_Valley_Victoria.html#" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tripadvisor.com.au/ShowUserReviews-g552277-d616758-r365513477-Balgownie_Estate_Vineyard_Resort_Spa-Yarra_Glen_Yarra_Valley_Victoria.html#</a></p></div></div></div></section></div><section id="Footer3col" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ms-p-h-2vw  colors-dark colors-local " data-reactid="24"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ms-bd-r ms-bd-w-1" data-reactid="25"><div class="Group Group-heading ms-p-r-4" data-reactid="26"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="27"><span data-reactid="28"><!-- react-empty: 29 --><h2 class="font-title" data-reactid="30"><a href="index.html" data-reactid="31">theromanticbloke</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="32"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="33"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ms-f-s-s w-s-wrap ms-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="34"></div></div></div></section></div></div>

Let's face it, your relationships with loved ones is the most important thing in your life. Everything else is white noise.
